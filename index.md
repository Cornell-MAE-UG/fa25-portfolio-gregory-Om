## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profPicCropped.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering Senior at Cornell University.

I’m a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at Cornell University who enjoys working where theory meets hardware and ideas are proven through experiment. My interests span advanced manufacturing, aeromechanical systems, and energy technologies, with a strong focus on hands-on, research-driven engineering. I’ve contributed to fusion energy R&D at Marathon Fusion, where I helped design, build, and test an ultra-high-vacuum plasma centrifuge, and previously conducted research at Cornell Engineering developing an experimental Dynamic Sized Droplet (DynaSD) additive manufacturing system to improve printing resolution and repeatability.

Along the way, I’ve worked on aeromechanical design and simulation at MagLev Aero, contributed to autonomous vehicle development with Cornell Electric Vehicles, and taught CAD and manufacturing workflows as a Fusion 360 Student Ambassador for Autodesk. I’m motivated by collaborative R&D, rapid prototyping, and building robust systems that push technical boundaries. I hope you enjoy exploring the projects and work showcased throughout this portfolio.
